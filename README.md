# node-app
This is a command line app using node js.  You can look up songs on spotify and it will return information on that song, if it does not find a song it will tell you the song is not available if the user does not enter a song it will return the default one.  You can do this for movie look ups and for concert look ups.  The last command will take what is inside of the random text file and run it, the do what it says can do all three commands one at a time.  Getting the LIRI(do what it says ) to work was a struggle but I finally got it.  I really like node because it is useful, fast, and javascript meaning I would not have to take a class or learn something like C# if I wanted to become a fullstack and go the javascript way.  The NPM are really helpful also and make my life really easy!
